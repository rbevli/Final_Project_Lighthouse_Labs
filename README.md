# Final_Project_Lighthouse_Labs

## Overview

This project looks into developing an app that contains two models.
- Build an efficient and accurate Toronto Home Price Predictor using Regression models.
- Build a Home Recommender System that takes an interested buyerâ€™s preferred house characteristics as inputs and recommends the 5 closest matching homes to the Buyer. 

Through the streamlit app's UI, the user can enter the home's characteristics depending on whether they are an interested buyer or an interested seller to get a recommendation or price prediction.

The app's link: [home.io](https://rbevli-final-project-lighthouse-labs-streamlit-app-bfb9kp.streamlitapp.com/)

## Results and Demonstration

Regression Model improved in performance after adding Crime Statistics. The model further improved after adding neighbourhood features using the Foursquare Places API. RMSE value decreased as new features were engineered.

Clustering Model successfully recommended  most similar homes.

## Future Goals

- Access to dates of listings so as to engineer socio-economic features such as mortgage rates, home inflation rates.
- Employ the use of Natural Language Processing do analyse the description of homes and extract useful features that are embedded in the textual description. Also employ Natural Language Processing for the recommender system so Buyers can input their preferences through a search engine.
- Remodel Regression and Clustering using Neural Networks so as to improve model performance!
